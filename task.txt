CoreLogic accounts were requested for you.
Usually it takes about a week.
Without this account you can’t get access to any CoreLogic resources (Git, Jira, Confluence, etc)

For this time your first task is:

1.	Install local env PCF Dev on your machines
See doc file attached, unfortunately it is outdated a bit so use it just for information.
https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry
https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-reactor

2.	Create  “Hello World” application on Spring Reactor
-	This application should receive data using REST call
Input data model – 2 lists of strings, 1st is a list of names of months, 2nd – list of names of week days
-	Request processing logic:
- in asynchronously mode
- sort both list in parallel (using Spring reactor)
- perform delay for months – 1sec, for week days – 0.5sec
- write results into log
3.	Ask Maksym and Roman about code review.
4.	Fix the comments.
5.	Deploy it on PCF Dev on your local machine
6.	Run it and let us check the results :)


Maksym and Roman can help with technical but it is appreciated is you google it before asking.
